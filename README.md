# numeric

C++-based library for numerical computation

Included at present are physically dimensioned quantities, linear
interpolation, and integration by adaptive quadrature.  These interoperate.

At the moment, a recent clang++ is required because g++ limits an identifier to
consist of ASCII characters.  However, numeric uses the character Î¼ in more
than one identifier.
