# numeric

C++-based library for numerical computation

Included at present are physically dimensioned quantities, linear
interpolation, and integration by adaptive quadrature.  These interoperate.

At the moment, a recent clang++ seems to be required because g++ seems not to
allow a non-ASCII UTF-8 character, such as Î¼, to be used in a C++ identifier.
